[SIZE="5"][B]About Project:[/B][/SIZE]
Citrus-CAF, unlike the name suggests, was initially based off CyanogenMod, in the early days of  Marshmallow, we even had another name at that point. Later, taking into consideration feedbacks of the very first slew of testers and carefully studying the needs and demands of our users, we rebased the project to Code Aurora Sources, more commonly known as CAF. Time went by and  Nougat released, and we decided that it was time, Citrus-CAF had to see the daylight. We rebased everything to the brank spanking Nougat released. Later we realized the true potential of CAF tags, how each of them altered the device performance on different SOCs. After a lot of thinking, we decided to keep different sources for difference SOCs in our git and hours of debugging later, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 was the first device to get a taste of our Tangy Nougat. In the beginning, it was just two people behind , but in time, a lot of people joined us, as each giving their own contibutions.

Citrus-CAF was built to create an amazing combination of customization, performance and most of the demanded features by our users, whereas we've Cardinal, to deliver minimal customizations, but the greatest stability!

Meanwhile, all of our Tangy sources are publicly available on our Github. We also do own a Google+ Community, where you can.... uhm... you know, do  what all others do at forums and communities! (Just kidding, we got builds over there and a feature-wish bucket too :P) Hope you enjoy your stay and taste the Tanginess of our work!

[COLOR="red"]NOTE: There's nothing like, "we've decided to keep the customizations minimum, so as to provide stock AOSP experience, but with necessary features", cause this isn't Cardinal. This is Citrus
